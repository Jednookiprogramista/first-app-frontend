### Introduction 👋



Welcome to my social media app **MyWall**, created using cutting-edge technologies such as TS, React, Express.js, Node.js, and MySQL. The premise of the application allows users to easily register and log in, with seamless access to features such as adding posts, comments, and friends all on the same page. These technologies enable the app to perform quickly, efficiently, and with ease of maintenance, ensuring an exceptional user experience.

### What did I do and what didn't. 🤔

It took me a lot of time to work on the front-end to make the website look its best, including attempts to create a dark mode for the entire site. Unfortunately, I had to postpone this feature, so I focused on configuring the back-end with routes and controllers. At the moment, I'm working hard to enable users to log in and register on the site. I am also adding a README.md to describe my experience with this project, as I need to submit it on time.

**I will continue working on the project until it is 100% functional.**

### How to run the project? 🚂

**Front-end -----------> npm start**

**Back-end ------------>start: ts-node index.ts**

**Back-end ------------>start:dev: tsnd index.ts**
