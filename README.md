### What did I do and what didn't. 🤔

It took me a lot of time to work on the front-end to make the website look its best, including attempts to create a dark mode for the entire site. Unfortunately, I had to postpone this feature, so I focused on configuring the back-end with routes and controllers. At the moment, I'm working hard to enable users to log in and register on the site. I am also adding a README.md to describe my experience with this project, as I need to submit it on time.

**I will continue working on the project until it is 100% functional.**

### How to run the project? 🚂

**Front-end -----------> npm start**

**Back-end ------------>start: ts-node index.ts**

**Back-end ------------>start:dev: tsnd index.ts**
